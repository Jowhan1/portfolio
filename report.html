                    HTML and CSS have been two of the most fun and rewarding languages I have ever learned. With the help of my instructor, Chris, I was able to quickly pick up the fundamentals. Initially, I was apprehensive about building a full website on my own, but as I began working with HTML and CSS, I realized how much I enjoyed it. After several lectures and exercises, I started feeling more confident in my abilities. This project made me realize that I truly enjoy web development, which was an eye-opening discovery for me.

                    As for the design of my website, I opted for a minimalistic approach with shades of blue, my favorite color. I feel that this color scheme fits the overall vibe I wanted for the website. For fonts, I explored Google Fonts until I found one that best suited my style. Additionally, I created a custom logo for my homepage using Wix. I am genuinely proud of how my website turned out, especially considering it's my first attempt at web design.
